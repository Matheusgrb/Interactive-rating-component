# Frontend Mentor - Interactive rating component

This is a nice, small project to practice handling user interactions and updating the DOM.

The users should be able to:

 - Select and submit a number rating
 - See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating
 - See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
